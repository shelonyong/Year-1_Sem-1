### 💭 Reflection
**Discrete Structure** is a fundamental subject that builds a strong foundation in computer science courses. It has helped me develop highly logical thinking when solving problems. Throughout this course, I have learned how to analyze problems using concepts such as sets, relations, functions, counting techniques, graphs and finite automata. These concepts have enhanced my ability to apply critical thinking to solve complex problems by breaking them into smaller parts. For example, use set theory, relations and functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and solve problems using recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees in real-world problems and use deterministic finite automata finite state machines to model electronic devices and problems. From my perspective, providing more real-world or computing-related examples makes students easier to connect their mathematical knowledge with computer science. Overall, Discrete Structure is hence an efficient stepping stone in my computer science journey and prepared me to face future complicated problems with full confidence.
