### 💭 Reflection
**Technology And Information System** introduces students to the fundamental concepts, components, and applications of technology and information systems, emphasizing their role in supporting individuals, organizations, and society. In this course, I understand the role of technology and information systems in modern organizations. I learned about the types of information systems, such as management information systems (MIS), decision support systems (DSS), and enterprise systems, and how they support business operations and decision-making. In my opinion, hands-on activities should be increased because they allow us to practice what we have learned, develop practical skills, and gain a deeper understanding of theoretical concepts. Furthermore, attending industry talks and visits has helped me understand what skills and qualities industries expect from graduates, which motivates me to develop them. To sum up, **Technology And Information System** has provided me a solid foundation for understanding how technology shapes modern organizations. I hope participating in this course and its activities will help me develop stronger communication skills, both written and verbal.
