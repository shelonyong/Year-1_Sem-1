On 11 December 2025, I had the honour of attending the ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025, an inspiring event that provided valuable insights into the rapidly developing field of quantum science and technology. This event brought together experts to share knowledge on the advancement of quantum technology and its growing impact across the ASEAN region.

This event began with a welcoming address by YBrs. Prof. Dr. Mohd Shafry bin Mohd Rahim, the Vice-Chancellor of UTM, followed by an officiating speech by YAB Dato' Onn Hafiz bin Ghazi, the Chief Minister of Johor. After listening to their informative speeches, I gained insights into Malaysia’s ongoing progress and development. I learned that JSSEZ and JTDC are not only about boosting foreign investments, but also about providing opprtunities for the youth. This made me realise that we, as the students play our rightful part in the future of quantum technology.

The first talk was delivered by 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐟. 𝐃𝐫. 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐚𝐡𝐢𝐫𝐨 𝐊𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐚𝐰𝐚, the 𝐐𝐈𝐐𝐁 𝐃𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 from 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐎𝐬𝐚𝐤𝐚. He introduced the fundamentals and future potential of quantum computing. This deepened my understanding of concepts, such as quantum qubits, superposition and quantum error correction. Besides that, he also shared an overview of Japan’s quantum strategy, promises of quantum computing, current developments in quantum research, and the challenges in building large-scale quantum computers. This session helped me appreciate the complexity of quantum technology and highlighted the importance of continuous research and international collaboration in advancing this field.

Finally, the last talk was delivered by 𝐌𝐫 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐊𝐞𝐨𝐤 𝐓𝐨𝐧𝐠, the 𝐄𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐃𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 from the 𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐮𝐦 𝐎𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐞, 𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐞. His talk emphasized on how collaboration between research institutions, industry, and international partners plays a key role in positioning Singapore as a leading hub for quantum innovation. From this talk, I learned that cross-sector and international collaboration is crucial in building a sustainable quantum ecosystem and maintaining global competitiveness.

Overall, the ASEAN QUANTUM SUMMIT 2025 has broadened my perspectives on quantum technology and highlighted the importance of continuous learning and cross-border collaboration in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. This was a valuable experience that strengthened my curiosity and interest in quantum technology.
