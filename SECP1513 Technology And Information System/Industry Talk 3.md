I had the opportunity to attend an online 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐲 𝐓𝐚𝐥𝐤 on 14 January 2026. The talk featured 𝐐𝐚𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐫𝐚 𝐑𝐨𝐡𝐳𝐚𝐧, the 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐭 𝐈𝐈 𝐚𝐭 𝐏𝐏𝐆, who delivered an insightful talk on 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬 𝐁𝐞𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈.

The talk provided valuable real-world insight into how theoretical concepts learned in class are applied in an actual industry environment. Through the speaker’s experience, I gained a clearer understanding that Power BI is not merely a visualization tool, but part of a much larger information system that integrates data sources, networks, hardware, software, and people.

One aspect that stood out was the speaker's use of the cooking and restaurant analogy to explain complex IT concepts. By comparing data to ingredients, networks to logistics, storage to warehouses, and BI developers to chefs, the session made complex ideas such as data flow, ETL processes, VPNs, and security much easier to understand. This analogy allowed me to clearly visualise how various components of an information system interact and are interconnected.

Through this session, I gained a deeper understanding of how network infrastructure and security influence data accessibility across different regions in real-world organisations. I learned that at PPG, servers hosted in different factories are protected by firewalls and regional VPNs, which can limit access to Power BI reports. In some cases, users must change their VPN location to view certain reports, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to authorised users. I also realised that access to some reports depends on being connected to the company’s local area network (LAN), as reports may be accessible in the office but not when working remotely. This helped me appreciate the critical role of network configuration in balancing both data security and accessibility within an information system.

Overall, this session deepened my understanding of information systems and strengthened my appreciation of how technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, and a positive learning mindset are essential for success in the IT industry.
