### 💭 Reflection
**Programming Technique I** is a fundamental subject that builds a strong foundation in programming using the **C++ language**. In this course, I learned how to analyze problems, design solutions using step-by-step logic, and implement them efficiently in C++ programming language. This course strengthened my logical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for future advanced programming courses. From my point of view, including a few more complicated programming examples would help students gain confidence and handle complex programming problems more easily.

At the beginning of the course, I found C++ challenging due to its strict syntax and logical structure. However, through continuous practice and exercises, I gradually improved my coding skills and gained confidence in writing C++ programs. Now, I feel a sense of satisfaction when I am able to identify errors in a program and successfully make it run correctly.

Overall, **Programming Technique I** has been a valuable course that built my confidence in C++ programming language and prepared me for more advanced programming subjects.
